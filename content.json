In practice IOT House uses the thermo-hygrometer AM2321 sensor and AI/DIO for control with TOCOS TWE-Lite via serial communication from the USB connection ToCoStick of Raspberry Pi. I think that network devices such as Switch and Router that can be configured with serial ports and console PCs can be used regardless of manufacturer or model. When automating the settings, Cisco Switch and Router copy and paste the text data created in advance and fill in the config.At this time, it is important to send delay of characters and line breaks to prevent the config data from being missed. epicon supports the transmission delay of important characters and line breaks as this serial console, and you can copy and paste the config with confidence.
